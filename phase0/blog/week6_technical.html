		<h2>Comparing Functional and Object-Oriented Programming</h2>
		<h3>Date: April 17, 2014</h3>
		<p>To my understanding, functional programming relies on fuctions like mathematical functions.  The inputs of these functions are givens and do not change according to various states.  This means that in functional programming, you avoid using elements that are mutable, or elements which you can change the value of after creation.  Functional Programming is good for when you have a fixed set of data and you will be adding new operations on this, usually with methods.  This way the fixed things are unchanged, but you can add new methods to change them, according to this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2078978/functional-programming-vs-object-oriented-programming">source</a>.</p>

		<p>Object oriented programming focuses on objects, of course.  All elements are objects in Object-Oriented Programming; and this programming focuses on how these objects act and interact. Object oriented programming is useful when you have set methods or operations and you want to create new objects without having to duplicate code.  You can accomplish this by using classes.  Classes set out the format and framework for an object.  You can create new instances of a class, as an object once the class is defined.  This object will have the parameters set out by the class.</p>

		<p><a href="http://zetcode.com/lang/rubytutorial/oop/">This tutorial</a> was helpful to my in furthering my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming and the usage of classes.</p>

		<p>Both Functional and Object-Oriented programming have their uses and weaknesses.  Which one to use depends on the scope and parameters of each project.</p>
