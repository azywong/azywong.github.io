		<h2>Exploring your values</h2>
		<h3>Date: March 21, 2014</h3>
		<p>When I think of the times in my life that I've been happiest or proudest, the values that come to mind are: Confidence, Enthusiasm, Excellence, Free time, Growth, Quality, Recognition, Personal development, Serenity, Truth and Wisdom.</p>

		<p>Growth is important to me for various reasons, one being that without growth, there is no change for the better.  For me, I want to try to become the best person I can be.  This is not to be confused with being the best at everything I can do.  Part of trying to be the best person I can be is growing and learning constantly.  Whether that is taking a class to learn something new, or trying new recipes, variety is the spice of life.  I like to try new things, and hopefully grow as a person in the process.</p>

		<p>In General this is my rating of how I try to live up to these values
			<br />
			<ul>
				<li>Confidence: 2</li>
				<li>Enthusiasm: 3</li>
				<li>Excellence: 4</li>
				<li>Free time: 5</li>
				<li>Growth: 4</li>
				<li>Quality: 4</li>
				<li>Recognition: 3</li>
				<li>Personal development: 3</li>
				<li>Serenity: 2</li>
				<li>Truth: 4</li>
				<li>Wisdom: 2</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>The last thing that someone asked my advice on was my mother.  It was about something minor; she was attending a ballroom dance event and wanted to know which outfit suited her more, and what accessories she should pair with it.  My mother frequently asks me advice on fashion and colors.</p>
