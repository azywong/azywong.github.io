		<h2>Chefs in the Kitchen</h2>
		<h3>Date: May 4, 2014</h3>
		<p>Kitchen vs. Restraraunt </p>
		<p>The video we watched for this blog entry summarized 2 types of thinking when entering DBC, and that everyone falls into both at some point.</p>

		<p>The first type of thinking is the 'Restraraunt' mentality.  Where you, the student are the consumer and the course is the item that you are paying for on the menu.  This is a passive approach to learning.</p>

		<p>The other type of thinking is the 'Chef' mentality, where the student takes an active approach to learning and controlling the direction of the curriculum.</p>

		<p>From my understanding, DBC hopes to foster the second approach to learning, something more hands on for the students, even though everyone will have days where they fall into the first group.  DBC instructors and mentors hope for students to take control and have an active interest in their learning rather than to be fully steered around.</p>

		<p>As for me personally, I feel like most of my K-12 schooling life, and even most of college fostered the first type of thinking.  Parents were quick to get angry with teachers if the child wasn't getting the grades.  I'm not sure how I'll do in this type of environment, but I'm excited to start and try my best!</p>

		<p>I think one of my problems initially will be learning to speak up when I have an idea, or when I need help.  Both are things that I'm getting used to doing.  Althought asking for help is getting easier and speaking up other times is still pretty hard.  I'm going to do my best to try to overcome this and try to stay excited and active during my DBC experience.</p>
