		<h2>Affirmation and Stereotype Threat</h2>
		<h3>Date: April 27, 2014</h3>
		<p>From my values blog post, some of the values I hold most dear are: Confidence, Enthusiasm, Excellence, Free time, Growth, Quality, Recognition, Personal development, Serenity, Truth and Wisdom.</p>

		<p>As for stereotype threat, it refers to "being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group," <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/definition.html">source</a>.</p>

		<p>I think as for how stereotype threat relates to my values, I think it doesn't help me live up to my values.  Stereotype threat would get in the way of Personal Development and Confidence mainly, not to mention Execellence, Frowth and Quality.  When encountering a situation where I am facing stereotype threat, I hope I keep my values in mind and overcome it.</p>

		<p>I'm not totally sure if my values can keep stereotype threat at bay because it is pervasive and subtle, but I will try my best to be aware and alert for it.  Also, living by keeping my values in mind is never a bad thing, and giving extra through to trying to live up to these values could aid personal development, even if stereotype threat wasn't an issue.</p>

		<p>I understand that DBC and life won't always be the smoothest ride, and I can think of several ways to help myself when I'm feeling down or discouraged.  </p>

		<p>The first one is one that I forget all the time:  take a break!.<br>
			I frequently try to power through any obstacles, especially when I'm feeling discouraged or frustrated.  I usually go 'bulldozer mode,' probably because I feel like I just need to try harder to get over this.  Sometimes it works, but when it doesn't I need to know when to step back and take a break, eat something sweet and do something else for a while, then come back when I'm calmer.</p>

		<p>Another one is to talk to someone. <br>
			Just like how powering through an issue might not be the best way, there is no shame in asking for help or sharing what I'm going through.  Other students or instructors might have additional insights through the challenge.</p>

		<p>Hopefully I can stick to these strategies and remember them next time I'm stuck or feeling down!</p>
