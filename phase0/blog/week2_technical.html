		<h2>Why is JavaScript so popular in web development?</h2>
		
		<h3>Date: March 19, 2014</h3>
		
		<p>A symptom of JavaScript's popularity is its widespread compatibility.  Every modern browser and virtually every device from computer, smartphone to tablet can run JavaScript.  But why is it so popular?</p>

		<p>Javascript started out as the language for Netscape Navigator, which was a major browser back in the day.  It was a tool that enabled websites to be more interactive, with popup windows and more.</p>

		<p>In today's world, JavaScript doesn't require access to a database or compiler in order to work, which makes its easy to implement on a website.  This means you can just put the JavaScript on your page and it'll work, just like that.  Without the need to set up anything extra to interpret the code.</p>

		<p>JavaScript also eases server load.  In terms of webpages, interaction used to be based on sending the server requests and relaying information between the browser and the server.  With JavaScript, once the page loads, then many of the interactive features can be handled by the browser instead of having to do further back and forth.</p>

		<p>Macromedia Flash also uses JavaScript in it's animation technology, and various other technologies have also incorporated JavaScript.</p>
		
		<p>Another thing that makes Javascript popular are Javascript libraries, such as jQuery.  JavaScript can be very time consuming to code.  A JavaScript library is basically a bunch of commands already written that you call on once you reference that library.  Instead of having to start from scratch and code something complicated, you can use a JavaScript library if it matches your needs.  Another important point is that using a JavaScript library may eliminate the frustration of coding with different browsers in mind, because that is already included!</p>

		<p>In terms of JavaScript Libraries, jQuery is popular for web development because it combines the interactivity of JavaScript in a library that is easy to use, and it also uses the same selectors as in CSS.  This makes it easy to incorporate into web development.</p>

		<p>In terms of 'how', it's hard to track the process of how JavaScript became so popular.  But in terms of 'why,' in today's world JavaScript is widely supported, easy to implement and is a cornerstone for making dynamic web applications.</p>
