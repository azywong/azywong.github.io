		<h2>Comparing SQL databases with NoSQL databases</h2>
		<h3>Date: April 27, 2014</h3>
		<p>SQL Databases are not just limited to a single database management system.  In general though, all SQL Database Management follow the Relational Model.  This means that the data is structured by relations betweeen data.  These database management systems are based on defined schemas and adhere to this format.  The format laid out is the basis for guidelines as to how the data is stored and used.  </p>

		<p>This model is very stable and is popular for storing data where the system can't take any losses.  Also, SQL databases usually have a similar query method implemented as they are structured.  You would use the SQL Model if your data has a set structure and you will be using queries to pull large amounts of infomation.</p>

		<p>On the otherhand, NoSQL Database Management Systems are the exact opposite of SQL Database Management Systems.  NoSQL Databases do not require a strict schema or model.  With NoSQL Databases, it is possible to group collections of data together in 'documents' that can be accessed all at once.</p>

		<p>The NoSQL model is more fluid when it comes to complex datastructures, and provides more flexibility, especially in terms of scaling.  You would use the NoSQL model if your project requires dealing with complex data which needs to be scalable.</p>

		<p>SQL and NoSQL databases both have their strengths and weaknesses.  Their useage can overlap, but in each unique case, its good to choose the solution that fits best and is the most simple to implement.</p>
