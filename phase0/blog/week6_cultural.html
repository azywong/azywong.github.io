		<h2>Stereotype Threat</h2>
		<h3>Date: April 17, 2014</h3>
		<p>Stereotype threat "refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group," <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/definition.html">source</a>.</p>

		<p>This basically means that for example if there is a negative stereotype that "people of color perform badly in school."  Then if you emphasize this stereotype and someone's skin color, they are vulnerable to believing this and undermining their own performance subconciously.  This can affect someone negatively because they might not perform to their full potential when the negative stereotype is always being thrown in their faces, due to being viewed through that negative stereotype or fear of confirming that stereotype.</p>

		<p>Stereotype Threat is important because if it holds true, then minorities are on even more uneven footing when it comes to jobs and education, among other important things.  Underperformance due to stereotype thread can negatively affect not just one person's life, but also impacts workplace diversity.</p>

		<p>In terms of stereotype threat, the effects may be far ranging and it would be impossible to single out and measure exactly how it affects so many lives today.  This issue is also closely related to systematic underperformance,  <a href="http://www.diversityinc.com/diversity-events/the-stereotype-threat-dr-claude-steele-mesmerizes-audience-video/">source</a>.</p>

		<p>In terms of just me, I think that stereotype threat probably subtley influences my life, but I'm not sure if I can pinpoint the effects.  My parents are great believers in education, and from an early age I was encouraged to pursue whatever I wanted; in fact my parents were strongly for a girl to take AP and Honors science and math classes.  In college, when I decided that the hard sciences were not for me and decided to pursue Managerial Economics, they were similarly supportive.</p>

		<p>Throughout my life I have never stood for anyone telling me that girls are worse at math and/or science, probably because of how I was raised.  I didn't end up pursuing science, but I did graduate with a B.S. in Managerial Economics and it was heavly maths-based.  I don't feel like I was going against expectations to achieve this; it was just what I wanted to do at the time.</p>

		<p>But this is just one example of stereotype threat that I can think of.  There are probably other examples I can't think of at the moment.</p>
