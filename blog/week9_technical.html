		<h2>Computer Memory</h2>
		<h3>Date: May 9, 2014</h3>
		<p>Computer memory can be broken down broadly into Temporary Storage, Permanent Storage.  Most of what we refer to as computer memory is Temporary Storage.</p>

		<p>Most data goes into the Random Access Memory (RAM), and things that the computer needs to access frequent go in the cache.  These are both Temporary Storage, which the CPU can access and write more quickly.  If the computer's CPU tried to run everything through the hard drive, it would be much slower.</p>

		<p>When you turn on your computer, it loads the read-only memory (ROM) and the basic input output system (BIOS).  Then it loads the operating system (OS) from the hard drive into the RAM.  The important parts of the operating system that are needed to run stay in the RAM while the computer is on to optimize performance.</p>

		<p>When an application is opened, it is loaded into RAM, and so are files you open.  When you close the application, the file is written to permanent storage and the application and corresponding files are deleted from RAM.</p>

		<p>The reason why there are different types of memory is the price point.  The cheapest form of memory is the harddrive, your permanent storage space.  Next up is RAM.  So it makes sense that most of the data is stored permanently on the hard drive and then loaded onto the RAM as needed. </p>

		<p>At the same time, RAM is not enough in order to match the CPU's processing speed.  For the data to reach the CPU it depends on the bus width (number of bits that can be transported) and bus speed.  This limiting factor makes it so that the time it takes the data to reach the CPU is more than the time it takes the CPU to process the data.  In order to solve this dilemna, there is the cache.</p>

		<p>The cache is also another type of temporary storage.  The cache is a small amount of memory that is built directly into the CPU, so the CPU can access it quickly.  The data that the CPU needs to access the most frequently is stored in the cache.</p>

		<p>And that's it for a brief look at computer memory.</p>
