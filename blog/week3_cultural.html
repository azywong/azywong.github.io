		<h2>Pairing and Giving Feedback</h2>
		<h3>Date: March 29, 2014</h3>
		<p>In regards to pairing, I felt like it was a strange experience to start with, and I still find it quite strange even after 4-5 sessions with different people.  Sometimes its hard to resist the urge to just type out things.  But I find that its important to consider your pair and articulate your thoughts, even in (maybe especially if) you don't understand or don't know how to proceed.</p>

		<p>During pairing I really came to appreciate another person's insights when I was stumped on a problem or stuck when the code wouldn't work for some reason.  At first it seemed like it was more frustrating to drive then navigate because you'd have to reliquish control of what actually got typed out on screen.  After a while I got used to it, and it wasn't that way at all when your pair listened and considered what you said as navigator.</p>

		<p>I liked taking turns navigating and driving, especially when the times were more or less equal.  Most of the people I paired with were extremely considerate and the majority of the time I felt like the session was much more productive than I was by myself.</p>

		<p>The only frustrating time I had when pairing was when I felt like my pair and I were not on the same page and weren't able to adequately articulate what we were thinking.  I think as I pair more with different people and learn more, this will gradually get easier and talking through problems will become more natural.</p>

		<p>In regards to feedback, on my feedback dashboard I have not seen anything yet to date.</p>

		<p>For giving feedback, its difficult to be specific, actionable and kind.  For me specific and actionable at the same time are usually the hardest.  I try to add something in my feedback as to possibly improve or keep in mind for the next time, but sometimes its hard to think of something right off the bat, especially if the pairing session went well and I can't think of anything to improve!</p>

		<p>On the flipside, I feel like its hard to give feedback that is 'negative.'  I guess I don't want to hurt someone's feelings, but at the same time in order to give kind feedback, we must be honest.</p>
