		<h2>Issues in Tech -- Culture</h2>
		<h3>Date: April 12, 2014</h3>
		<p></p>

		<p>This issue has been widely discussed on the net by both men and woman in and outside the tech industry.  The bottom line is that there are a disproportionately small number of women working in tech compared to men.  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/technology/technologys-man-problem.html?_r=0">this article</a> opens up the discussion and cites statistics from the National Center for Women & Information Technology.  Apparently in 2009, women held about a quarter of all information technology jobs.  The industry is dominated by white males and some argue that the culture is that of casual misogyny.</p>

		<p>The case in question is when 2 developers presented an app called "Titshare," which according to one of the developers is "an app where you take photos of yourself staring at tits."  Following that, people took to twitter to lambast or defend the app.  This opened up a can of worms about the culture of the tech industry and how this might be damaging or sexist towards women.</p>

		<p>At the same time, this isn't the only lense which tech culuture can be viewed through.  <a href="http://butyoureagirl.com/2014/04/09/technologys-culture-problem/">Another article</a> brings up another important issue surrounding this controversy: Intersectionality.  The first article by the NY Times interviews two white women and tells their stories within a predominately white industry.  It brings up the issue of sexism as something a white woman faces, and doesn't include any mention of minorities or women of color.  The main main issue at hand is the underrepresentation and harassment of of various groups in the tech industry, which include people of color, minorities and women.</p>

		<p>While people can argue about whether or not this is an "issue," it doesn't seem right to me that that the tech industry is dominated by white males.  The first article cites the culture as a problem: women see that the men are 'mean' and sexist, so they prefer not to subject themselves to that kind of environment, so they don't stay in the industry.  This summary may or may not be true, but it seems like there is a serious problem if women and people of color don't feel safe or respected in the industry of their choice.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, the culutural problem is subtle and it's hard to change attitudes quickly, other than just trying one at a time.  Because the tech industry isn't one big agency that is moderated by a single entity, its hard to enforce changes.  Especially in the start up scene where the culture is more relaxed and less hierarchical, and people may stick to hiring their friends/people they know.</p>

		<p>I think in order for there to be change, this issue needs to be something that won't just disappear after a few articles, it needs to stay current and in the forefront of people's concerns.  Change will probably be slow, but will have to be unified and attitude changing across the industry.  Because the industry isn't regulated, this change needs to come from within.</p>
