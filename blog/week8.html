		<h2>Experience with Design and Blogging</h2>
		<h3>Date: April 30, 2014</h3>
		<p>My experience with blogging for DBC and trying to write for an audience has been challenging, but not altogether unpleasant.</p>

		<p>First of all in relation to blogging for learning, I have to admit at first I really disliked it.  Having to research a topic not only to the point of understanding, but also to the point of being able to explain was extremely time consuming.  Sometimes I would have absolutely no background in the topic, so I would have to search for sources from the very basics and try to interpret it my own way.  My first technical blogs were probably the most painful.</p>

		<p>At the same time, I have to admit that the extensive research helped me understand the topics at hand more fully.  Even if the topic wasn't particularly interesting to me, in order to be able to explain it I would have to read up a lot on it.  Usually I tend to try to cut to the chase and just try to find out why something doesn't work, or find the syntax for what I'm trying to do.  I usually feel like I'm pressed for time and shouldn't be going into extra research for certain topics if its not needed for me to complete a challenge.  But if you take the example of the Arrays and Hashes blog, that knowledge stuck with me since I had to read, write and explain it, not to mention format the examples.  So in that way writing a learning blog post was technically beneficial.</p>

		<p>Writing for an audience and writing to reflect on myself have also been interesting experiences.  I'm usually not used to writing something outside of an academic paper (rare) or quick lists (less rare).  I guess when writing a blog post its useful to think of who might read it, and then ramble less and/or pay more attention to structure and readibility.</p>

		<p>Designing and writing blog posts has been enlightening.  My first blog post (now edited to fit the format of my template)  originally featured 3 columns for no good reason and a patterned background.  It was hard to read, the colors were way too bright and the layout of the content made very little sense for consecutive posts.  Keeping the content in mind while formatting the blog was key in this case.  I still have a lot to work on, but I feel like my blog/website looks a bit better now!</p>

		<p>In the future, I might want to do more with media queries on this website, but at this point I'm pretty happy with how most of the blog is formatted.  I'm less happy with the index, but hopefully inspiration will strike sometime!</p>
