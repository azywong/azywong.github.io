		<h2>Dealing with Conflict</h2>
		<h3>Date: April 4, 2014</h3>
		<p>An instance of a time when I was in an emotional conflict with someone would be several years ago when I was in high school and was fighting with my older sister.  I'm not totally sure what started this conflict now, but as it went on, there was name calling involved and digging up of old issues.  I think at the time I was fed up with her keeping me up at night in our shared room when she was on the phone with her then boyfriend for hours.  It didn't help that I disliked him too.  This was also on top of other various issues that come up when you have 2 teenaged sisters sharing a room. </p>

		<p>I think the real source of the conflict was lack of communication.  I got fed up with what I thought was my sister's lack of common courtesy (staying up all hours on the phone, kicking me out of the room when her boyfriend visited, etc) and suddenly exploded one day.  I didn't voice my grievances in a constructive way and just threw it in her face with no warning and with no solution.  I was just mad and wanted to put it out there. </p>

		<p>Well I actually started the conflict, so in retrospect I'm not sure I can say I handled it well at all.  At the time, I got fed up with something my sister said and decided to dump all my grievances on her at once.  Whether the grievances were relevant to the issue at hand or not, I don't remember, but they probably were not 100% relevant.  I resorted to digging up every single example of how she had wronged me ever, and yelling.</p>

		<p>My actions (yelling, bring up unrelated issues, being agressive) definitely did not help make the conflict better.  In fact, I'm pretty sure they made it much, much worse.</p>

		<p>If I could go back, I would probably try to voice my concerns when they came up and were relevant instead of holding onto them and explodng at a later time.  That way grievances could be voiced and the discussion could stay on track more easily while dealing with one conflict instead of dredging up everything.  I would also try to avoid raising my voice.</p>

		<p>This experience was not a positive one, but I learned the simple fact that people are not mind readers.  When in doubt, just say something.  I thought the standards of common courtesy to others were pretty clear:  don't talk on the phone for hours when the person you share a room with is trying to sleep.  But my sister did not think of this as an issue at all until I brought it up.</p>
