		<h2>Your thinking style</h2>
		<h3>Date: May 9, 2014</h3>
		<p>My <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Gregorc Thinking Style</a> is mainly Abstract Random and Concrete random (tie).</p>
		<p><b>Abstract Random Thinkers</b> organize information by reflecting and do well in people-oriented environments that are loosely structured or totally unstructured.  They also like working in healthy group environments, and focusing on the main issues.  The do well in personalized enviroments with group projects and general guidelines.  They don't do as well with competition, criticism and restrictions or an authoritative environment.</p>

		<p><b>Concrete Random Thinkers </b>are good with abstraction and theory.  They like experimenting to find answers and do independent solving.  They do well when they're able to use trial-and-error and have time to solve through things by themselves, or compete with others.  They don't do as well with formal reports, lots of restrictions, routines and re-doing things onces its done.  They're also not so good with showing how the got the answer and having no options.</p>

		<p>These two thinking styles have contradictory points, but I can see how I fall between the two categories.  I think I definitely organize information by reflectina and I love pairing/working collaboratively rather than competitively.  I also use the trial-and-error approach a lot when it comes to coding and solving.  When I need to figure out something, I either fiddle on my own until it works or ask someone to teach me.  Both methods work rather well.</p>

		<p>On the flip side, I'm not so good with competitive environments, restrictions and criticism.  With the competitive enviroment, to some extent life and job hunting will be a competition, so its not like I can totally avoid it.  I hope however, that in the DBC learning environment, that we're able to learn and grow and share together.  With restrictions, it sounds like DBC is a hands off kind of environment that isn't super strict with format, so we'll see how it goes!  I don't think I'll have trouble following rules or anything like that.  And in regard to criticism, I will be sure to refer back to my compass of shame and try to deal with criticism constructively.</p>

		<p>As for what I've had trouble with in DBC so far, I think the main thing is Javascript.  I wasn't able to work through it and 'fiddle' with it as much as I did with Ruby, so I think thats why I feel less comfortable with it.</p>
