		<h2>Arrays vs. Hashes in Ruby</h2>
		<h3>Date: March 29, 2014</h3>

		<p>Arrays in Ruby are a way of saving multiple values in one variable. The format is as follows</p>

		<blockquote>my_array_name = [1, 2, "string", 4, 5]</blockquote>

		<p>Arrays can store numbers, strings or even other arrays.  You can access elements in the array with the following syntax, by using their index number, starting from 0:</p>

		<blockquote>my_array_name[0] # => 1 <br />
			my_array_name[1] # => 2 <br />
			my_array_name[2] # => "string" <br />
			my_array_name[3] # => 4 <br />
			my_array_name[4] # => 5		<br />						</blockquote>

		<p>Hashes on the other hand, are similar to Arrays in that they can store multiple values.  But instead of using a numbered index to access values, hashes use key: value pairs.  The notation looks something like this:</p>

		<blockquote>my_hash_name = { key: value }</blockquote>

		<p>Hashes can also store numbers, strings, other hashes and arrays.  Similar to Arrays, you can access elements in a hash by referring to the key, as illustrated by the following example:</p>

		<blockquote>new_hash = { red: 1, <br />
			blue: 8, <br />
			yellow: 10} <br />
			new_hash[red] # => 1</blockquote>

		<p>While Hashes and Arrays are similar, they are not always substitutable.  For example, if you were using a variable to hold a list of people's names and test scores, you would probably want to use a Hash.  That way you could access each person's test score by using their name as a key.  Otherwise, accessing each score using a numbered index would make less sense, and you wouldn't be able to link each person to their scores.</p>

		<blockquote><p>test scores as a hash</p>
			test_scores = {<br />
			adam : 90,<br />
			bob : 75,<br />
			cathy: 89<br />
		}</blockquote>

		<blockquote><p>test scores as an array</p>
			test_scores = [90, 75, 89]</blockquote>

		<p>Take another example:  If you were using a variable to hold a list of desserts, you probably wouldn't need to use a hash because there wouldn't be a need for key value pairs.  You coul just structure it as follows:</p>

		<blockquote>desserts = ["strawverry chiffon cake", "apple pie", "lemon sorbet"]</blockquote>

		<p>When coding it is best to think about the intended usage and structure of the code before implementing the data structure that fits, whether it be a hash, array, or something else entirely.</p>
