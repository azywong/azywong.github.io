		<h2>User Experience and Design Analysis</h2>
		<article class="subcontent">
				<h3><a href="https://www.facebook.com/">https://www.facebook.com/</a></h3>
			<p><span class="large-cap">F</span>acebook is a social networking site that most people in the world are already aware of.  In terms of user experience though, the site is constantly changing and hopefully improving it's design and unsability.  At the time I'm writing this blogpost, facebook has recently done yet another cosmetic update.  In terms of general layout, there are 4 columns at the moment.  From left to right they are: links to groups and apps, the main "status feed", trending and reccommended pages and the live feed/chat panel.  The site's layout is very busy with as much images and text crammed in as possible.</p>
			<p><span class="large-cap">F</span>or me, this is way too cluttered.  After using Facebook for 30 minutes, my head hurts from way too much going on.  I feel like they could minimize a bit possibly by eliminating some duplicate content (you can access the messages from 2 places on the screen at the moment).  I feel like currently users are used to the busy layout, but that doesn't mean there isn't room to improve.</p>

			<p><span class="large-cap">O</span>n the other hand, Facebook does have its color scheme right.  It's simple, easy on the eyes and the system of blue, white and grey is distinct, but not overly jarring.</p>


			<p><span class="large-cap">I</span>t helps a bit that you have the option of minimizing the chat window, but I feel like if you want that functionality, dealing with 4 columns of information at a time is a bit much.</p>

				<h3><a href="http://tumblr.com/">http://tumblr.com/</a></h3>
			<p><span class="large-cap">T</span>umblr is a popular blogging platform for many different kinds of users.  Users can customize their own blog layout or choose from a variety of layouts made by other users.  In terms of sepcific blogs, it is hard to rate them, as each blog has it's own unique feel, so I'll be evaluating tumblr's dashboard.</p>
			<p><span class="large-cap">T</span>umblr's dashboard is the aggregrate feed of all the Tumblr blogs you follow.  The theme of this part is also customizable if you don't like the default colors, but the general layout is the same.  I like how minimalistic the layout of this part of the site is.  The main emphasis is on the content or pictures that make up your "dash" and you can seamless scroll through the most recent posts made.</p>
			<p><span class="large-cap">A</span>t the top of the dashboard are icons for posting, and a sidebar for navigating your blog and a bar for search and messages.  I like how the main emphasis is on the content you're scrolling through.  The other links like "reccommended blogs" and "radar" are subtle and don't chase you as you scroll down the page</p>
			<p><span class="large-cap">I</span> think Tumblr is doing something right here.  The site isn't too dense and is focused on the content.  The dashboard is easy to use and navigate, with the more important links/icons being larger and more emphasized.  The layout makes sense and isn't too cluttered.</p>

				<h3><a href="http://www.deviantart.com/">http://www.deviantart.com/</a></h3>
			<p><span class="large-cap">D</span>eviantArt is an art sharing/portfolio website.  I will be evaluating the home page at the moment.</p>

			<p><span class="large-cap">F</span>or me, DeviantArt's color scheme is familiar.  Some people may feel like the green/orange combination is a bit strange, but DeviantArt manages to pull it off without being overly obnoxious.  The colors aren't too saturated and gives emphasis to the art that is being showcased on the site.</p>

			<p><span class="large-cap">W</span>hile browsing through the hompage, you can see a variety of recent posts made by other users.  I like how Deviantart minmized the links by just using icons for the main links; if you want more information, you can click to the main page for each piece of art and further browse.  They also include a snippet of the artist's description and an option to comment.</p>

			<p><span class="large-cap">I</span>n terms of <em>just</em> looking at images, the commenting feature under each piece seems like a waste of space.  But the philosophy of the website shines through at this point.  There is an emphasis on commenting, feedback and userinteration.  So adding the commenting feature, while taking up space, is actually integral to the website.</p>


			<p><span class="large-cap">W</span>ith the homepage, the emphasis is placed on browsing art: there is the top navigation bar, but as you scroll, the main focus is pieces of art with a small side bar for category links for more browsing.  Unlike Facebook, the polls and other features are place in the footer, as to not interupt the browsing process with extra clutter and to place emphasis on the art by showing large images.</p>
